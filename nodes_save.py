"""H3SaveVideoWithMCtx: MP4 + mctx sidecar, one transaction.

Owns its encode so the MP4 and the sidecar are written by one node with
one trustworthy pairing hash -- deliberately NOT downstream of VHS or
another saver. Transaction order: MP4 first -> hash it -> sidecar tmp +
os.replace. Sidecar existence is the commit point; a crash in between
leaves a plain playable video.

The encode itself pipes raw frames to an ffmpeg subprocess when a binary
is available (VideoHelperSuite's mechanism, ~2.2x faster), and otherwise
falls back to core's in-process PyAV path. Owning the transaction and
borrowing the faster mechanism are independent choices -- see
