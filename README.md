# comfyui-obvpm-timeline

A MiniMax H3 ComfyUI workflow and nodes that allow generating, extending, prepending, bridging and editing videos in an easy to use UI.

The timeline node is like a mini video editor.

And it also supports creating seamless looping videos.

## Updates

### 0.1.0 (2026-09-21)

- First release.

## Watch the Tutorial

The best way to learn how to use the Timeline and workflow is by watching the YouTube tutorial video:

## Features

The main node is the **Timeline** node: the clips you generate are placed on it, and it is where you arrange, cut and preview them, and pick which clip the next generation continues from.

Generate a clip, see if you like it, add it to the timeline, then extend from it. Any part you don't like can be redone later.

Every generated clip is saved together with a motion context file (`.mctx`) that holds its latents. Extensions continue from those original latents using latent masks, not from re-encoded pixels, so there are no lighting changes or flickers at the joins. And because the files sit next to the clips, a clip can still be extended at full quality days or months later.

**Generating**

- **Extend** a clip seamlessly.
- **Prepend**: generate what happens *before* a clip
- **Bridge**: generate what happens between the end of one clip and the beginning of another. This lets you redo any section of the video, and bridging onto a fresh generation brings the quality back if it has drifted.
- **Loop**: bridge the last clip back to the first clip to make a seamless looping video.
- **Extend from a cut**: if a clip ends badly, cut off the bad part and extend from the good part. Snap cuts keeps cuts on the latent frame grid.
- Clips that have no motion context (external clips, clips from other workflows) can be extended too, with seam improvements applied automatically.
- **Result preview**: plays each new clip joined to its neighbours and rates how seamless the join is. From there you add it to the timeline, delete it or dismiss it.
- **Model preview override**: Integrated into the result preview. Lets you quickly see if a generation is going wrong.

**Timeline**

- **Custom audio for lip sync**: upload or drop a soundtrack onto the audio row below the video strip. Generation, extension, prepending and bridges automatically encode the matching audio window, including pinned overlap. See [custom audio setup and timing](docs/custom-audio.md).
- **Mini Video Editor**: Drag in clips from anywhere, reorder them by dragging, trim the ends, cut left / cut right at the playhead, undo cuts, and open gaps.
- **Quick preview**: plays through the clips right away. **Full preview** assembles them into a single video file, losslessly where possible. **Export** saves the finished video.
- **Load Settings, Prompts from Clips**: restores the prompt, seed, settings and references that a clip was generated with, so you don't have to keep track of them yourself.
- **Swap takes**: Swap between previous takes generated for the same extension, so you can go back to them and swap between them on the timeline.
- The sequence is also available as text, for copying a timeline into another workflow.

**Upscaling**

- A latent upscale and refine of the **whole sequence in one pass**, so details stay consistent across the joins and the result is still seamless.
- Sampling is done in windows, so long or high resolution videos still fit in VRAM.
- Generate at low resolution for fast iteration, then upscale once at the end. This is optional, you can also generate the first pass at final quality.
- Each clip's conditioning is saved with it, so the upscale uses the same references the clip was generated with.

**Workflow**

- Organized for fast and easy use. All inputs are in one area. No pan all over the workflow to change things.
- **Settings Presets**: Allows you to save frequently used settings such as steps, turbo, and sampling settings and control them in one place
- Up to four image references, plus video and audio references. (More can be added)

## Dependencies

The **workflows** use these custom node packs, so install them too (ComfyUI Manager's *Install Missing Custom Nodes* finds them):

## Installation

Clone (or copy) this folder into `ComfyUI/custom_nodes`:

```
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/chanon/comfyui-obvpm-timeline
```

Restart ComfyUI. No extra Python dependencies are required. A ComfyUI
from 2026-08-13 or later is needed.

## Workflow

The workflow is available in the [workflows](https://github.com/chanon/comfyui-obvpm-timeline/tree/main/workflows) folder.

## Other Notes

Every node in this pack is listed with **(obvpm)** after its name, so
searching the node menu for `obvpm` finds all of them. The names used
throughout this documentation leave that suffix off.
