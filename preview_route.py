The timeline widget plays the preview as ONE continuous stream -- the
only way a preview can be truly gapless (two <video> elements can never
be sample-locked). For all-copyable sequences this is a packet copy,
sub-second; seams needing bridges decode only the bridged clips.

The preview is a SINGLE file per Timeline node, at
output/<base_folder>/<preview_filename>.mp4, overwritten on every
build; a meta JSON beside it records the content key so staleness
survives page reloads AND ComfyUI restarts (it deliberately does NOT
live in temp, which is wiped at startup). Because the URL never changes
per build, players must cache-bust with the returned "v". Export =
promote: ensure the preview is current (rebuild if stale), then copy it
beside itself under export_filename_prefix with the normal counter --
the export is byte-identical to the preview by construction.

These are stateless utility routes, NOT review gates: they drive no
generation, hold no state, and keep the loop-less design intact.

    The two repairs COMPOSE -- they do not overlap, and neither replaces
    the other:

      the crossfade ends on the parent's level (the incoming frames are
      matched onto it before blending), so it removes the switch between
      two renderings of the same moment;

      the level lock then corrects the child's DELIVERED frames, which
      still open off-level -- the model's drift does not stop at the end
      of the pinned window, it peaks there and decays over the second
      that follows.

    An earlier version dropped the step correction wherever a fade ran,
    on the theory that the fade "already handed the level over". It does
    not: it hands over to frames that are themselves drifted, so
    suppressing the lock left the whole opening step in place and the
    fade merely walked into it.

    The third return says where a fade must carry the level over ITSELF
    -- see crossfade.handover_ramp. That needs BOTH conditions:

      the level lock is off, so nothing else is going to do it; AND
      the join actually measured a step worth carrying.

    The second is not redundant, and getting it wrong is a regression on
    the joins that were already fine. levellock.plan returns no entry
    for a join whose step and swing sit inside the frame-to-frame noise
    -- there is nothing to correct. Reading "no entry" as "nobody is
    fixing this, so ramp it" therefore fires the ramp on every clean
    join in the sequence and moves a level that measured flat. The lock
    being OFF is what means "nobody is fixing this"; the measurement is
    what means "there is something to fix".
