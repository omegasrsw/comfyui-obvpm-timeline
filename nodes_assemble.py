"""H3Assemble: sequence clips into one MP4, seams derived from sidecars.

The assembler's job is the last mile of the lineage system: the sidecar
headers already record who joins whom and at which raw frame, so given an
ORDERED list of clips this node derives every seam cut itself:

  R extends L   ->  L exits at (R.join_raw - L.pinned_head); R enters at 0.
                    A plain tail extend puts that exit exactly at L's
                    delivered end (no cut); a trim-point extension or the
                    auto-shifted extend of a prepend-made clip lands the
                    exit earlier, cutting the frames that belong to the
                    other seam.
  L prepends R  ->  L plays whole; R enters at (L.join_raw - R.pinned_head).
                    Prepend to a root enters at 0; prepend to a
                    continuation enters at the conserved 12-frame offset.
  no relation   ->  butt join (L whole, R from 0), with a warning.

Writing is smart-cut: every clip's played range [enter, exit) is split
into COPY runs -- packet spans that start at an IDR keyframe and end at
one (or at the clip end), stream-copied bit for bit -- and BRIDGE runs,
the sub-GOP remainders around a mid-clip seam, re-encoded from the
already-decoded frames with the same PyAV H.264 path the save nodes use.
A whole-clip sequence is therefore 100% copied (zero video generation
loss); a mid-clip seam re-encodes only the frames between the cut and the
nearest keyframe on its side. Since our saves use x264's default GOP
(~250 frames), short takes carry a single IDR at frame 0 and a mid-clip
entry re-encodes that one clip; longer takes with interior keyframes get
true sub-clip copying automatically.

Audio is decoded, concatenated sample-accurately and encoded ONCE as a
continuous AAC track regardless (copying AAC packets across a splice
always clicks: each frame overlap-adds with its neighbor, so the first
~21ms after a splice decodes with a fade-in artifact).

The whole path is defensive, because splicing packets from different
encodes is exactly where players glitch: every piece (bridges included)
must match the first clip's codec/extradata/dimensions/time base byte for
byte, frame counts are verified per piece, and DTS monotonicity is
enforced while muxing. Any surprise raises _StreamMismatch and the node
falls back to one full decode -> re-encode rather than writing a broken
file. The source takes remain the masters either way.

No sidecar is written: an assembly is a delivery, not a take -- it has no
latents of its own to store.

    A bridge is spliced between stream-copied packets of the same clip,

    the PPS. So a bridge written at a different crf has different codec
    extradata, _mux_pieces refuses the splice, and the whole assembly
    falls back to re-encoding every frame in order to repair twelve.

    Measured: takes were written at one crf while previews defaulted to
    another, so the smart cut was being lost on every repaired sequence
    -- silently, because the fallback still produces a correct file. The
    SPS matched; only the PPS differed. This is why the defaults were
    later moved together (to 19, 2026-08-28) rather than one at a time:
    a mismatch here costs quality on every frame of the assembly, not
    just the repaired ones. Older takes carry their own crf and are
    matched individually, so a folder may hold several and still splice.

    Matching the SOURCE rather than the caller's request is also the
    right output: every other frame of that clip is copied at its
    original quality, so a bridge at a different crf would be a quality
    step inside one clip.

    A non-integral crf returns `default`: the pack's encoders take an
    int, so we could not reproduce it anyway and guessing would put the

    (web/h3_mctx_ui.js) and the stateless routes (preview_route.py): the
    full preview is a server-built smart cut, and the export button
    promotes that exact file into output/. The node is not an output
    node, so queueing a generation while composing costs nothing.

    The one thing that CAN execute is the `pin_specs` output: pin a clip
    in the widget (extend its tail / prepend its head) and wire the
    output to H3MCtxApplyPins, and the timeline becomes the source of the
    next generation's continuation -- no loader node, no MCTX wire. The
    pin lives in the hidden `pin_state` JSON widget (owned by the UI, one
    opaque channel so richer pin shapes never change the node's
    signature); the clip is re-verified against its sidecar hash at run
    time, exactly like H3LoadMCtx. With no pin the node emits an empty
    spec list, which Apply treats as plain root generation.

    For an in-graph assembled result (feed frames onward in one run),
    use H3 MCtx Assemble instead.
